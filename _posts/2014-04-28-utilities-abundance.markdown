## Welcome to this new destination

First thing I did, when the urge to blog more regularly again came up, was moving the few better posts of my existing ones from [WERKSHOW](http://werkshow.com) at [Squarespace](http://squarespace.com) to a self-managed [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) installation on my [Github account](https://github.com/benjaminfritz). Let me tell you, this was no easy feat for a guy with exactly 0 experience with the Terminal whatsoever.

But I feel like it’s worth it. Especially if I will stick to my plan.

So, let’s kick it off with a thought that came to my mind recently:

**Will there be a time in the future where we’ll go back to a one home screen only ”setup“ on the iPhone?**

The last couple of months I managed to restrict myself to two homescreens with a total of two folders: one with the Apple defaults and one for *”I don’t like to keep you on the front but may need you at some time*“-kinda apps.

Now, the draft for this article resided for a long time in my drawer because I'm still afraid of publishing my thoughts publicly. But in the last days more and more people touched this topic in different ways:

You probably stumbled upon the article [Designer Duds: Losing Our Seat at the Table](http://mokriya.quora.com/Designer-Duds-Losing-Our-Seat-at-the-Table) by **Mills Baker** recently where he pointed out all the beautifully designed apps that get released these days where there's kind of a hype at the beginning because of their pretty design or exceptional user experience but fall short on delivering ongoing purpose for the user besides being joyful to use. **If not you should read it.**

Then mastermind **Frank Chimero** published his thought piece [No New Tools](http://frankchimero.com/blog/no-new-tools/) in which he elaborates on the fact that we nowadays urge to try out any *new tool on the block* instantly and find this freshness more important than actually using the existent ones up to their true potential. We should focus on solving problems and not on fixing seemingly broken tools, he concludes.

And last but not least this tweet by **Harry Keller** kicked me in the butt to finalize my thoughts on the topic:

<blockquote><p>Just spent 30 mins reorganising my iPhone home screens. I am not the only one doing this, right? <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23fwp&amp;src=hash">#fwp</a></p>&mdash; Harry Keller (@harryfk) <a href="https://twitter.com/harryfk/statuses/460362824959922176">April 27, 2014</a></blockquote>

So what's wrong with us currently accumilating the biggest belt of tools just to notice a shift in focus from using them to meet our needs to organizing those tools and trying new ones as soon as they hit the market and get stuck in the loop while doing so?

Me, I'll continue in my quest to evaluate each tool in my virtual belt and get rid of those that don't serve me but just seem to be nice to have. *Thoughts?* Comments, please.

**Edit:** I see the first ones coming in [on Designer News](https://news.layervault.com/stories/21499-no-new-tools)
