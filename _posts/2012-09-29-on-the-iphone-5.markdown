This post solely serves the purpose of expressing my opinion about the iPhone 5 release, too. Because I think everybody should feel obliged to spit out something about everything.

But seriously:

As a true Apple fanboy I watched three live tickers about the Apple Keynote yesterday at once, sucking up every bit, phrase and picture that The Verge, gdgt, etc. streamed live from the event.

What I took out of it?

First: I found it strange that the One More Thing came right upfront. The iPhone 5 was clearly (as in everybody knew it before) the main act of the show and every product that was presented afterwards obviously faded away in the shadows of the big player. Which at the same time brings me toâ€¦

Second: Is it just me or does every iPod iteration feel like the junkyard brother of the iPhone nowadays? E.g. the A5, known from the iPhone 4S lives on in the iPod Touch. It gets the same Retina display in 4" but lacks other parts and doesn't feel like a product on its own. And: Why bother continuing the Nano line anyway?

The iPhone 5 itself didn't overwhelm me that much (mostly 'cause most of the specs has been leaked way before) but history shows that it offers its true potential while in hand and use.

Sure thing that <strike>I'm gonna buy one</strike> I bought one.
