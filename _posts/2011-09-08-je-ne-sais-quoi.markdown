I can’t believe it but it’s actually already two weeks ago that Nadja and I went on vacation to visit the beautiful city of Paris, France. It was her first stay there and it’s been a year ago when workmates and me have been there to attend the [OFFF 2010 conference](http://www.offf.ws/ "OFFF Let's Feed The Future").

Needless to say it was another experience than the last time and gladly I’ve just recently bought a new lens for my trusty camera of choice, the [Ricoh GXR](http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/gxr/special/). The [A12 lens](http://www.ricoh.com/r_dc/gxr/unit4.html) sports a fixed focal length of 28mm with a F2.5 aperture and I gotta say it’s a pure joy to use. All the pictures in this post are from the trip and if you want to see the whole album, head over to the corresponding [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/antiheld3000/sets/72157627591802462/).

We spent four days in a lovely apartment in the suburbs of Paris and I want to use this chance to emphasize the amazing first-time-experience we had with the private renting (startup/)service [airbnb](http://www.airbnb.com/) (and please do me the favor and don’t use one of those horrible copycats like *wimdu* or *9flats*, thanks).

The apartment belongs to a young, warm French couple who didn’t only provide us with shelter, cozy sheets and leftover food but also with amazingly valuable tipps and hints for local, tasty dining, bars and nice spots for a night out. So besides the really cheap and comfy accommodation, we got additional service which we didn’t even think about to ask for. Did I mention **they even left us their laptop** to look things up and get directions? All in all a perfect example of mutual trust and respect. If you plan a travel to Paris make sure to consider hanging out at [their place](http://www.airbnb.com/rooms/34285) instead of in a pricy hotel in the city center.

Don’t hide yourself in anxiety because of [the recent news regarding the airbnb fraud](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/27/the-moment-of-truth-for-airbnb-as-users-home-is-utterly-trashed/). I’m definitely going to book my next accomodation there again. Especially now that they learned from this fiasco and got you covered in every case: [airbnb safety policies](http://www.airbnb.com/safety).

To end that resume – we had a blast and I hope you got a little glimpse on it. Enjoy your weekend.
