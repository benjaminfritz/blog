So this won't be news to most of you but I've recently grown into the feeling of boredom and unexcitement more and more when visiting once personally popular networks like [Facebook](http://facebook.com) and sadly [Instagram](http://instagram.com), too.

Interestingly enough I can take a break from [Twitter](http://twitter.com), let the stream continue to flow without my engagement and jump right in back again without [FOMO](http://caterina.net/2011/03/15/fomo-and-social-media/) - it instantly catches me like I never left. And I wonder why that's the case.

**Facebook** with its last additions continues to clutter up the overall experience. The piece of information that still interests me - the *News Feed* - takes up a bit more space than a third of the total viewport buried inbetween navigation (**necessary!**), contact list (+ chat), ticker, ads, notifications (all not primarily necessary to be accessible in the first hierarchy layer). At the same time *content* there gets irrelevant soon.

If that wouldn't be enough, now recommendations, ads, and stuff that *maybe* could spark interest in me and seldomly does, invade the only piece of content that draws me to the site. **Don't like**.

The point with **Instagram** is that I'll still develop a serious FOMO when letting days pass without me taking a glimpse but then when I catch up (*which is much easier than anywhere else thanks to the image related character of the network*) I notice that there are mostly the same experience and collection of events happening over the days, so missing one or two mostly *similar days* won't hurt me.

What I truly like though is the enhanced activity on slow weekends and less noise during workdays when there wouldn't be no time to catch up anyways.

Back to Twitter: Although I get bored from time to time, it works taking a break, come back some time later and still be able to be in the loop and know what's going on in the mostly tech & design related world in which I meander.

At last by now you probably notice that I'm relatively unsure about how I want to play along and what's the best use for me not to speak of what an ideal future in terms of relevancy and enrichment of life for those kind of networks could be.

**What about you?**
