**Video offline :/**

It has been a long time since I've seen such a inspiring piece of documentary like *Jiro Dreams Of Sushi*. I searched for a opportunity to watch it in Germany since it's only shown in cinemas across the States until now but finally some nice guy uploaded [the entire movie to YouTube (offline)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=JorsEExDnMc).

The trailer already gave away a glimpse of the dedication with which Jiro executes his work. He talks about his craft with such a passion, conviction and consideration and you can see it in every second you see him preparing the finest sushi dishes you can imagine.

I don't want to spoil the whole movie as I recommend everyone who struggles with the purpose of work from time to time to watch it.

The words that stuck with me were, as well as I can recall them, the following ones:

*Love what you consider your work. Your work directs your life. Never complain about your work. If you don't like your work change it.*

Or as I saved it for myself: Everybody should spend most of the time of his/her life with the occupation that brings the most joy and fulfillment for him/her.
