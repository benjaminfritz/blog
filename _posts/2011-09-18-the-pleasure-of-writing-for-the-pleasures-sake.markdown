I *like* to write - and maybe it's because I love to read a lot, too. It's pure enjoyment to learn something new even if it's not necessarily in my usual field of interest. Or just right because it isn't. Often those peripheral matters spark a certain curiosity to dig deeper into another expertise which you tend to ignore when working in a profession that makes your mindset to be focused on certain topics â€” design, advertising and user experiences in my case. I like to write - which doesn't mean that I shine in writing in particular. Contrarily the act on refinement of my own words and noticing the own clunky sentences enable me to look on what I produce from another perspective and further give me a chance to reflect on thoughts in their rawest form.

I *like* to write - because it's not the field I'm the expert in. Again that creates the necessary distance between the content I wanna write about and the natural pressure I put on myself when creating a personal output that can be viewed and critised in public. With a beginner's mindset the benchmark's pretty low.

I *like* to write - the mind wanders, usually in a distraction-blocking environment, time on your side and in good company or isolated on your own in a little bubble.

I *like* to write - and that's why.
