Typically for me — instead of updating the content on this site by sharing what's going on in my life I started to update its template and design **again**.

Most recently I celebrated my birthday with some friends in our yard, had a decent BBQ and too much drinks. Luckily the sun was nice to us so everyone involved had a blast as far as I know. The secret star of the show though was our [boombox](https://jawbone.com/speakers/bigjambox/overview), you should get one: It's got enough power and pressure to entertain a happy group of ten to fifteen people.

Actually beforehand we planned to have another boat trip on the Spree because that's what we did with [Tweek](http://tweek.tv) some weeks ago to farewell one and welcome another employee and frankly it was amazing.

Unfortunately all the boats were booked way ahead so we decided to postpone that. I can highly recommend renting some with [Floß und los](http://www.flossundlos.de/) nevertheless. You basically get a big enough raft with chairs, a wooden tent and a BBQ grill on top for a decent price split between the five people that one of these can carry.

Let's hope we are able to enjoy some more days of sunny weather and soon can take another trip to the [*Island of Youth*](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insel_der_Jugend).

Professionally our team at **Tweek** just [released an interim update](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/tweek-social-tv-live-fernsehen/id499215733?mt=8) on which we worked for quite some time and I'm happy we finally got it out to you.

It includes the design [Christoph](http://christophjaeger.com/) ([Dribbble](http://dribbble.com/christoph)) and me worked together on for some weeks and I'm pretty proud of the outcome — given that we didn't change the code base and just re-skinned it mostly.

The goal was to brighten up the experience and evoke a friendlier feeling when browsing inside the app and let the backdrops and video items shine instead of burying them in the existing black holes. **I hope you like it.**
