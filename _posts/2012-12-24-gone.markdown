![Old flat in Stuttgart](http://cl.ly/UaO6/libero.jpg)

*My old and now empty flat right above a cozy but often noisy soccer bar called Libero*

Three days ago I finally packed all my stuff and got ready to leave what was my home for more than two years now.

I have been thinking about leaving for almost the entire past year but never made a move. So when it was decided that all of the residents of the house I lived in had to leave because of a grand scale renovation at the end of the year and I have grown to become more and more unsatisfied with my tasks at work it was my turn to decide what to do next.

Luck was with me when I got to know that wonderful girl in the midst of this year which soon lies behind us. She's my girlfriend for the better half of the year now and every day with her by my side proves to be better than the days before. **I thank you so much, my dear.** But "by my side" unfortunately has been more of a metaphor than a fact because she lives in Berlin and so far I have been a inhabitant of rural city Stuttgart in Southern Germany.

*Until now.*

I finally quit my job in autumn, sold most of my furniture and all the other *Krimskrams* for small change so by now I am finally ready to move on. To Berlin. With my life, my love and work, too. The later will hopefully enable me to enjoy the former appropriately.

My year ended merrily and although I will miss my friends & family sorely, I look forward to the next one with a bold smile on my lucky face. **I wish all of you happy holidays and an equally happy new year. Make it yours.**
