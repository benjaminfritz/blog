Just finished watching this brutally honest and at the same time encouraging talk by [Ben Pieratt for Creative Mornings](http://creativemornings.com/talks/ben-pieratt/2). Hits the nail on so many levels, see all the projects I started in a way more smaller scope (read: no real idea behind them). What I got out of this, is the importance of continuous trial and iteration of stuff the way it fits you the best and care for the outcome at the very very last. If even at all.

Thanks, [Ben](http://twitter.com/pieratt "@pieratt").

And don't miss the [Q & A](http://creativemornings.com/talks/ben-pieratt/1).
