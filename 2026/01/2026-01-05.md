# Pretty loaded first words

I don't know why, but this piece of internet writing resonated with me.

[A website to destroy all websites.](https://henry.codes/writing/a-website-to-destroy-all-websites/) by Henry Desroches

Social media feels tiring and dull; I long for original ideas, long-form writing, and substance.

I merely check a couple of social apps consistently. Instagram consumes most of my time, but it's almost entirely ads and reels now. I uninstalled Threads because its algorithm is weird, and Instagram keeps trying to push me into it via strange links to random posts. I don't enjoy Instagram anymore, but I feel like it's the last place where I'm actually connected to people online (I'm well connected in real life, no worries).

Of course, I try to compensate by posting and consuming less, reading more books, and listening to more music. With podcasts in particular, I'm more intentional and selective.

Like most people, I spend most of my time on my mobile, and I want to make that time more valuable — ideally to wean myself off it a bit more.

Let's see how this goes in the new year. Happy one to you! 🎆
